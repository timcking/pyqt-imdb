Ok, get_titlesRefs is (mostly) an internal method,
and only returns links to titles as found in
the texts (biographies, plot summaries and so on).

To get the other information, the objects instances
of the Movie class work like python dictionaries.
You can get a list of available information with:
  b.keys()

After that, you can do things like:
  b.get('actor')
  b['visual effects']
